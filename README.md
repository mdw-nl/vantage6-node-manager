## Quick Start

### Using Pre-built Docker Image (Easiest)

Pre-built images are automatically built and published via GitHub Actions.

1. **Pull the latest image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/mdw-nl/vantage6-node-manager:latest
   ```

2. **Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name vantage6-node-manager \
     -p 5000:5000 \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v ${HOME}/.config/vantage6:/root/.config/vantage6 \
     -e SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
     ghcr.io/mdw-nl/vantage6-node-manager:latest
   ```

3. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Development)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vantage6-node-manager
   ```

2. **Create environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set your SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vantage6-node-manager
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Creating a Node Configuration

1. Navigate to **Nodes** > **Create New Node** in the web interface
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **Node Name**: A unique identifier for your node
   - **Server URL**: The URL of your Vantage6 server
   - **API Key**: Authentication key for the server
   - **Database Configuration**: Path to your data file and its type
   - **Encryption** (optional): Enable end-to-end encryption and upload your private key
3. Click **Create Node Configuration**

#### Encryption Setup

Vantage6 supports end-to-end encryption to protect communication between nodes and ensure data privacy. When creating a node:

1. **Enable Encryption**: Check the "Enable Encryption" checkbox
2. **Choose Your Key Source**:
   
   **Option A: Generate New Key (Recommended for new organizations)**
   - Click the "Generate New Key" tab
   - Click "Generate New RSA Key Pair" button
   - The application will create a secure 4096-bit RSA key pair
   - Download your private key immediately using the "Download Private Key" button
   - The key will be automatically saved with your node configuration
   - **Important**: Share this downloaded key with all other nodes and users in your organization

   **Option B: Upload Existing Key (For existing organizations)**
   - Click the "Upload Existing Key" tab
   - Select your organization's RSA private key file (PEM format)
   - The key will be securely stored with your node configuration

3. **Important**: All nodes and users in your organization must use the same private key

**How it works:**
- All task inputs and results are encrypted using RSA keys
- The server cannot read encrypted communications
- Only your organization (with the private key) can decrypt messages
- A shared secret is used for symmetric encryption of the payload

**Key Security:**
- Private keys are stored securely in `~/.config/vantage6/node/private_keys/`
- Files are set to read-only permissions (0600) for the owner
- Back up your private key safely - losing it means you cannot decrypt existing messages
- Never share your private key with other organizations
- Generated keys use 4096-bit RSA for maximum security

### Starting a Node

1. Go to the **Dashboard** or **All Nodes** page
2. Find your node in the list
3. Click the **Start** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
4. The application will automatically detect the server version and use the appropriate node image
5. The node will start in a Docker container

**Note**: The node version is automatically determined by querying the server's `/api/version` endpoint. If you need to use a specific version, use the "Advanced Start" option in the node details page.

### Viewing Node Details

1. Click on a node name or the **View** button (üëÅÔ∏è)
2. View detailed configuration information including auto-detected server version
3. See real-time container logs (for running nodes)
4. Access quick actions: Start, Stop, Restart, Delete

### Stopping a Node

1. Navigate to the node details page
2. Click the **Stop** button
3. The node container will be stopped gracefully

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for session management (required in production)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production` or `development`
- `VANTAGE6_CONFIG_DIR`: Custom path for vantage6 configurations (optional)

### Node Configuration Files

Node configurations are stored as YAML files in:
- **User configurations**: `~/.config/vantage6/node/`
- **System configurations**: `/etc/vantage6/node/`

Example configuration structure:
```yaml
api_key: your-api-key
server_url: https://server.vantage6.ai
port: 443
api_path: /api
task_dir: /tmp/vantage6
databases:
  - label: default
    uri: /path/to/data.csv
    type: csv
logging:
  level: INFO
  file: my-node.log
encryption:
  enabled: false
```

## API Endpoints

The application provides REST API endpoints for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/nodes` - List all node configurations
- `GET /api/nodes/<name>/status` - Get status of a specific node
- `GET /api/server/version?server_url=<url>&api_path=<path>` - Check Vantage6 server version
- `GET /nodes/<name>/logs` - Get container logs for a running node

### Example: Check Server Version

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/server/version?server_url=https://server.vantage6.ai&api_path=/api"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "version": "4.7.1",
  "server_url": "https://server.vantage6.ai",
  "recommended_image": "harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/node:4.7.1"
}
```

## Architecture

The application consists of:

1. **Flask Backend** (`app.py`):
   - Route handlers for web interface
   - Docker client integration
   - Configuration file management
   - Node lifecycle management

2. **HTML Templates** (`templates/`):
   - `base.html` - Base template with navigation
   - `index.html` - Dashboard with statistics
   - `nodes.html` - List of all nodes
   - `new_node.html` - Node creation form
   - `view_node.html` - Node details and logs

3. **Docker Integration**:
   - Uses Docker Python SDK to manage containers
   - Mounts configuration files and data into containers
   - Manages container lifecycle (create, start, stop, remove)

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
python app.py
```

The application will run with debug mode enabled and auto-reload on code changes.

### Building Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t vantage6-node-manager .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# TODO: Add tests
pytest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Docker is not running or not accessible"

**Solution**: 
- Ensure Docker daemon is running
- Check Docker socket permissions: `ls -la /var/run/docker.sock`
- If using Docker Compose, verify the socket is mounted correctly

### Node Won't Start

**Problem**: Node fails to start with error

**Solution**:
- Check the node configuration file for errors
- Verify the API key is correct
- Ensure database files exist and are accessible
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs <container-name>`

### Cannot Access Web Interface

**Problem**: Cannot connect to `http://localhost:5000`

**Solution**:
- Verify the application is running: `docker ps` or check the terminal
- Check if port 5000 is available: `lsof -i :5000`
- If using Docker, ensure port mapping is correct in docker-compose.yml

### Encryption Issues

**Problem**: "Encryption enabled but no private key file provided"

**Solution**:
- Ensure you've uploaded a valid private key file when creating the node
- The private key must be in PEM format
- Generate a new key pair if needed: `v6 node create-private-key`

**Problem**: Node fails to start with encryption errors

**Solution**:
- Verify the private key file exists and is readable
- Check that the private key matches the public key on the server
- Ensure all nodes in your organization use the same private key
- Verify the collaboration requires encryption (check with server admin)

**Problem**: Cannot decrypt task results

**Solution**:
- Confirm you're using the correct private key for your organization
- Verify the public key on the server matches your private key
- Check that other nodes in the collaboration have encryption enabled
- Ensure the private key hasn't been changed since results were encrypted

## Security Considerations

- **Change the default SECRET_KEY** in production
- Store sensitive information (API keys) securely
- **Protect your private keys**: Never share them with other organizations
- Back up private keys securely - losing them means losing access to encrypted data
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Restrict Docker socket access appropriately
- Consider implementing authentication for the web interface
- Regularly rotate API keys and encryption keys according to your security policy
